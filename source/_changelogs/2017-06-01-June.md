## Platform Improvements
### Pantheon Upstream Configuration
Organizations utilizing a [Custom Upstream](https://pantheon.io/docs/custom-upstream/) can now set default site configurations, such as [nested docroot](https://pantheon.io/docs/nested-docroot/), in the `pantheon.upstream.yml` file. For details, see [Pantheon YAML Configuration Files](https://pantheon.io/docs/pantheon-yml/).

### Default PHP Versions
New [WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress/pull/123) and [Drupal 8](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8/pull/189) sites now run PHP 7 by default. [Drupal 7](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7/pull/107) sites will default to PHP 5.6.

### Core Upgrades
[Drupal 8.3.4](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.3.4), [Drupal 7.56](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.56), and [WordPress 4.8](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/) have been pushed to all Site Dashboards.

### Terminus 1.4.0
If you haven't updated in awhile, checkout the [Terminus Changelog](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/updates/#changelog) to see what's new and [update to the current release](https://pantheon.io/docs/terminus/updates/#update-to-the-current-release-)

### WP-CLI
WordPress CLI on Pantheon has been updated to version 1.2.1. You can read the release notes for this update [here](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/06/06/version-1-2-1-released/).

### New Relic
New Relic's APM Availability Monitoring has [known incompatibilities](https://pantheon.io/docs/new-relic/#apm-availability-monitoring-alerts-and-false-positive-downtime-events) with SNI, which our [Free HTTPS](https://pantheon.io/docs/free-https/) uses. Instead, we recommend configuring the free availability monitoring service within New Relicâ€™s Synthetics Lite tool. For details, see [New Relic APM Pro](https://pantheon.io/docs/new-relic/#configure-ping-monitors-for-availability).
