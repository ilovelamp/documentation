## Platform Improvements
### Pantheon Upstream Configuration
Customers using [Custom Upstreams](https://pantheon.io/docs/custom-upstream/) can now set a `pantheon.upstream.yml` file to set default options for child sites. You can read all about it in our [docs](https://pantheon.io/docs/pantheon-yml/#custom-upstream-configurations-pantheonupstreamyml).

### PHP Upgrades

All new [WordPress](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/WordPress/pull/123) and [Drupal 8](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8/pull/189) sites now run on PHP 7 by default. [Drupal 7](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-7/pull/107) sites will default to PHP 5.6.

### CMS Core Upgrades

[Drupal 8.3.4](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/8.3.4), [Drupal 7.56](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/releases/7.56), and [WordPress 4.8](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/) have been pushed to all Site Dashboards.

### Terminus 1.4.0

### WP-CLI

WordPress CLI on Pantheon has been updated to version 1.2.1. You can read the release notes for this update [here](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/06/06/version-1-2-1-released/).

### New Relic

Our [documentation](https://pantheon.io/docs/new-relic/#configure-ping-monitors-for-availability) explains how to use New Relic Synthetics to create an availability monitoring service.

### Bug Fixes

For [Drupal 8.3.3](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8/pull/187) sites and above, `drush cache-rebuild` now clears the [Pantheon edge cache](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8/pull/186) as well as Drupal's own cache.
